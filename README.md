# Provenance model
The EMBRC provenance model documentation and example files

This repository holds the documentation and examples related to the provenance model for non-clinical, non-human, biological samples and data, that has been developed by EMBRC within WP6 of the EOSC-Life project (Horizon 2020 programme grant agreement number 824087). The focus is to create a model for providing provenance information for biological material that is collected and/or processed in EMBRC partner stations/labs and the data that is created from that biological material. The model represents a "gold standard" to strive to achieve. In the real world, the actual amount of detailed provenance metadata that are/need to be provided will depend on the details of the project under which the material and data are produced, the use to which that material and data are put. 

* Documentation: the explanation of the model can be currently found on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HhHCjzkVwIQoEJANtLIiFyheIFxuvT6MORDlgOg6xUo/edit
(comments are welcomed). Once the model is ready for a version 1 release, this documentation will be moved here to Github.
* [UML of the model](https://github.com/emo-bon/provenance-model-docs/blob/main/ProvenanceModel_UMLclassDiagram.svg)
* PROV diagram of the model: TBD
* [EML example](https://github.com/emo-bon/provenance-model-docs/blob/main/EMBRCprovmodel_example.xml). This is a suggestion as to how the provenence information can be included in a metadata record in EML. Note that the EML metadata schema cannot accommodate all of the aspects of the model. 
* [TTL example](https://github.com/emo-bon/provenance-model-docs/blob/main/embrc_prov_example.ttl). This is a suggestion as to how the provenance information can be included in a turtle file.
